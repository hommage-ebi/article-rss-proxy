This\nis primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual\ninformation which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models\nlike ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback\nmodel based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of\nspoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio\nlanguage models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the\nnonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample\nfeedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized\nevaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a\npreference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both\ncomprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios\nspan various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of\ninstruction chats, and implicit chats.

The Qwen3 series\nincludes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with\nparameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is\nthe integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and\nnon-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified\nframework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as\nchat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,\nQwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat\ntemplates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing\nusers to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby\nbalancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by\nleveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the\ncomputational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring\ntheir highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nQwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including\ntasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc.,\ncompetitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its\npredecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119\nlanguages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved\ncross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate\nreproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models\nare publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.", "authors": ["An Yang", "Anfeng Li", "Baosong Yang", "Beichen Zhang", "Binyuan Hui", "Bo Zheng", "Bowen Yu", "Chang Gao", "Chengen Huang", "Chenxu Lv", "Chujie Zheng", "Dayiheng Liu", "Fan Zhou", "Fei Huang", "Feng Hu", "Hao Ge", "Haoran Wei", "Huan Lin", "Jialong Tang", "Jian Yang", "Jianhong Tu", "Jianwei Zhang", "Jianxin Yang", "Jiaxi Yang", "Jing Zhou", "Jingren Zhou", "Junyang Lin", "Kai Dang", "Keqin Bao", "Kexin Yang", "Le Yu", "Lianghao Deng", "Mei Li", "Mingfeng Xue", "Mingze Li", "Pei Zhang", "Peng Wang", "Qin Zhu", "Rui Men", "Ruize Gao", "Shixuan Liu", "Shuang Luo", "Tianhao Li", "Tianyi Tang", "Wenbiao Yin", "Xingzhang Ren", "Xinyu Wang", "Xinyu Zhang", "Xuancheng Ren", "Yang Fan", "Yang Su", "Yichang Zhang", "Yinger Zhang", "Yu Wan", "Yuqiong Liu", "Zekun Wang", "Zeyu Cui", "Zhenru Zhang", "Zhipeng Zhou", "Zihan Qiu"], "category": "cs.CL", "updated": "2025-05-14T13:41:34Z"}

Results across 17 datasets\ndemonstrate that PT-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both question\nanswering (QA) and mathematical problem solving tasks, improving F1 score by\n1.49 points over PT and 2.13 points over LoRA in QA tasks, while enhancing\nmathematical accuracy by 10.75 points over PT and 0.44 points over LoRA, all\nwhile using 25% fewer parameters than LoRA. Our analysis reveals that while PT\nmethods generally excel in QA tasks and LoRA-based methods in math datasets,\nthe integration of matrix decomposition and MoE in PT-MoE yields complementary\nbenefits: decomposition enables efficient parameter sharing across experts\nwhile MoE provides dynamic adaptation, collectively enabling PT-MoE to\ndemonstrate cross-task consistency and generalization abilities. These\nfindings, along with ablation studies on routing mechanisms and architectural\ncomponents, provide insights for future PEFT methods.", "authors": ["Zongqian Li", "Yixuan Su", "Nigel Collier"], "category": "cs.CL", "updated": "2025-05-14T16:16:36Z"}

Traditional creativity assessments\nare often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human\nratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In\ncontrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual\nembeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We\nevaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish,\nGerman, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating\nrobust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts. Unlike prior DAT\napproaches, the S-DAT shows convergent validity with other DT measures and\ncorrect discriminant validity with convergent thinking. This cross-linguistic\nflexibility allows for more inclusive, global-scale creativity research,\naddressing key limitations of earlier approaches. S-DAT provides a powerful\ntool for fairer, more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility in\ndiverse populations and can be freely assessed online:\nhttps://sdat.iol.zib.de/.", "authors": ["Jennifer Haase", "Paul H.

Recent advances\nin test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in\nenabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift\ntoward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging\nTheory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that\nformalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking\nprocess. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate\nretrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate\ninformation through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we\nconstruct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning\ntrajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across\ngeneral question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed\nreal-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over\nbaseline methods.
